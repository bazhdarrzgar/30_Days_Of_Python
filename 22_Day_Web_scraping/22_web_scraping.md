## Python Web Scraping

### What is Web Scrapping

Web scraping is the process of extracting and collecting data from websites and storing it on a local machine or in a database.

To start scraping websites you need _requests_, _beautifoulSoup4_ and a _website_.

```sh
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

```py
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

```py

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
url = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php'

# Lets use the requests get method to fetch the data from url

response = requests.get(url)
# lets check the status
status = response.status_code
print(status) # 200 means the fetching was successful
```

```sh
200
```

```py
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
url = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php'

response = requests.get(url)
content = response.content # we get all the content from the website
soup = BeautifulSoup(content, 'html.parser') # beautiful soup will give a chance to parse
print(soup.title) # <title>UCI Machine Learning Repository: Data Sets</title>
print(soup.title.get_text()) # UCI Machine Learning Repository: Data Sets
print(soup.body) # gives the whole page on the website
print(response.status_code)

tables = soup.find_all('table', {'cellpadding':'3'})
# We are targeting the table with cellpadding attribute with the value of 3
# We can select using id, class or HTML tag , for more information check the beautifulsoup doc
table = tables[0] # the result is a list, we are taking out data from it
for td in table.find('tr').find_all('td'):
    print(td.text)
```

If you run this code, you can see that the extraction is half done. You can continue doing it because it is part of exercise 1.
For reference check the [beautifulsoup documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#quick-start)

ðŸŒ• You are so special, you are progressing everyday. You are left with only eight days to your way to greatness. Now do some exercises for your brain and muscles.

## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 22

1. Scrape the following website and store the data as json file(url = 'http://www.bu.edu/president/boston-university-facts-stats/').
1. Extract the table in this url (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) and change it to a json file
2. Scrape the presidents table and store the data as json(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States). The table is not very structured and the scrapping may take very long time.
