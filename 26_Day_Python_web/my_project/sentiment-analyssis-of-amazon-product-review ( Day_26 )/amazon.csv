0,5.0,I am very happy to buy this product...Nice product...üëçüëç..
1,4.0,"Amazingly AmazonIt says 8 hrs but since I use this to watch lectures it gives more than 15hrs+ battery life.Sound quality is good, Highs & Lows are perfectly managed but to term these as Bass Heavy would be widely mistake.Overall 4 stars"
2,4.0,base kingthe base is really good. it a value for this range of money.i really liked it.only the comfort has to be more good.
3,1.0,"The head phone plastic band broken out.This product was had manufacturing defect inside the plastic band material,from which it is now broken out, that could not be visible during product receiving time period. Please do something for this automatic damaging, I wanted number of time to connect with customer care service but no any my call receiving by customer service. Please do the satisfactory advice to repair or exchange purpose because this product is under guarantee period. I was received this order on 14 May 2020."
4,2.0,"Cheap Plastic, Average product.  Sound is distorted at high volume.Edit: After 1 year of usage.The headphone starts developing cracks in the overhead plastic band, the padding on the earcups and head band started coming off. The boat logo has completely vanished (all this happened even after taking utmost care). The sound is still fine.Please be aware of the cheap plastic and poor built quality of the headphone. Instead of this you can buy Blaupunkt BH01 Eqz headphones which are the best at this price.PS. The gold plating on the AUX cable will come off creating much disturbance while connecting and listening to music rendering it useless.EDIT: The sound cut-offs are annoying during watching films or playing. You can't hear some dialogues at low volume.Honest review after 46 days of usage...PROS:‚Ä¢ Good sound quality, vocals are crystal clear. Nice to see AUX cable bundled in the box itself.‚Ä¢ You can get rich bass in Bluetooth and above average bass using the wired connection.‚Ä¢ The ear cups are padded with good quality foam and faux leather, no pain on continuous use (Used it for 2-2.5 hours and was still very comfortable).‚Ä¢ Value for money, Got it for 1099/- only.‚Ä¢ Not Bass heavy but you can tweak settings to get good bass.‚Ä¢ Good fit and design.‚Ä¢ Good Battery backup, got 7 hrs+ on single charge. Full charge takes about 2-3 hours, the orange LED goes off when fully charged.‚Ä¢ Build quality is good considering the price of the product.‚Ä¢ Call quality is average (the speaker is not so loud). The headphone also tells the Caller‚Äôs Number during an incoming call.‚Ä¢ The Latency is also acceptable at this price point.CONS:‚Ä¢ On Bluetooth, when the volume is kept very low and the music has a very low pitch, sometimes the left-right speakers turn ON and OFF automatically. (It can be eliminated by keeping volume bar at about 50%, also no problem when connected using Aux cable). I saw this problem in boAt Rockerz 450 as well.‚Ä¢ When kept at 100% volume the sound tends to get distorted. (Its THD-Total Harmonic Distortion is ‚â§5%, whereas most good headphones have it at ‚â§1%)‚Ä¢ The aux cable seems to be too thin so be careful while handling it.‚Ä¢ The earcups are not sweat resistant so take care of it."
5,5.0,Value for the moneySound is very crystal clearBass is very pretty and goodValue for money
6,1.0,Don't buy it please...Bass is disgusting... Range is good but when I tried PUBG it keeps disconnecting continuously...Useless headphone...I returned it on the same day I received.
7,1.0,Cheap QualityI have used it for 1 month after then the headphone literally breaked. Please My Dear friends a slight little push can break it. Headphone quality Is Cheap. Not for gamers. Dont Buy It
8,4.0,"After 2 month reviewMarvelous performanceIf you watch movies or series in Netflix,amazon or Hotstar this head set is perfect option Crysta clear sound may be not deep bass but you feel like theatre effect with perfect clear sound just go for it ....."
9,1.0,"Broken within one month!!!I have been a huge fan of BoaT and have been purchasing headphones and wireless-only from them since it is an indian company.But, i was let down on the above product. Within one month the thing is broken. The sad part is that, when I uploaded the invoice which was downloaded from Amazon itself, the company BoaT has send a message to me stating the invoice is not theirs. So weird!!!So, when it comes to faulty products they have funny excuses to say NO."
10,1.0,Not goodMy ears and head stared paining. It's uncomfortable and the bass is also not good. The sound also bursts.
11,4.0,Pro and consI would like to start with pro sound is good and battery life also goodNow the con's you can't use it on summer because it will heat up you're ear and you can't use it for long time because it will hurt ear overall I can say it's a good product but I can't use it on summer it's hurting my ear
12,5.0,"It's goodAfter reading these reviews where some people really didn't like it and where some people loved it, I got really skeptical. I probably was about to cancel my order. But I got it anyways and It's so good. It fits my ears perfectly, it doesn't pain even after hours of usage. The sound is more than loud enough with enough bass and also has this really good theater effect. Kinda makes me look like a gamer girl not gonna lie lmao. But, anyways. So far my experience has been good. And yes it might be a little delicate but which headphones are not??? Just buy it guys don't fall for the bad reviews this headset is beautiful!!!"
13,5.0,Ok superSuper mind blowing
14,2.0,"Bad product I  wish I could give 0 stars to itThis product has poor built quality there is no voice cancellation at first when I ordered it it was pretty well but it started giving me problems after few weeks it had problem in connectiveti with Bluetooth and in some calls it would automatically ends the call . It not at all good for gameing . It has a very poor noise cancellation fataliti . After few weeks it just broke by stretching when I was wereing it for use poor quality if you are buying it is only good for less use or it will start creating problem it has an average sound quality.it is not good for meeting ,classes, gameing  very bad quality recommended not to buy this product is very bad no noise cancellation facility very bad build quality so you should not buy this product .very bad product this by stretching it breaks so build quality is very bad it does not  has an noise cancellation facility and this auxillary works not very well so I recommend not to buy this product"
15,2.0,Problem with itThe headphones are kinda good in terms of the audio quality and battery backup.......but the build and the quality of the headphones is not that great as the ones which I ordered broke like shown in the photo and this happened very close to the time I actually ordered it and started using it........I used the headphones as I would have used any other headphones but the headphones just came apartü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
16,3.0,"Sound Quality Is Great, but Build Quality Poor!Sound is all good and good hearing over bluetooth too, when connected to mobile / laptop. But 2 major issues I experienced:1. Cannot use bluetooth for making calls, attending meeting where I need to speak. The receiver is not able to hear my voice even though I kept the volume to maximum. So I am forced to use a wired connection for the mic to pickup my voice and make it audible to the other side.2. The build quality - Bought this in April 2021. The headset broke 10 days back, making it unusable. This is the first time a product like headset is broke [see photo] within 6 months of usage. I could have used it for not more than 200 hours at the maximum. Don't know if this is covered in the 1 year warranty that Boat has promised. Now I bought another headset of another brand. Actually disappointed with Boat over these issues."
17,2.0,Poor ergonomicsBought it almost 4 months ago.Works fine while using it with the aux cable. But while in bt mode the music kinda fluctuates in low volumes.( Either left or right cut off or both of them cut offs)Had it increase volume so that the music starts Playing again.Not so happy with how it sits on my head.Might look good but ergonomics are poor.The build is alos not that satisfying.Already had many hairline cracks.
18,4.0,Bluetooth ConnectivitySound quality is no doubt a good point becoz of Boats company but i feel its Bluetooth connectivity is little bit pathetic sometimes it does connect with anybody else's phone and just make sure tht u have Ur phone very near 2 u otherwise there's a glitch which I heard from Google is dangerous due to the rays and I'll recommend u too charge even at 90 % battery becoz glitch starts to occur otherwise and yess it doesn't fall while exercising so that's a good point 2 me. Overall since 2 months usage it's been good and I keep it in its box only after usage and I got at a reasonable price so it's grrt fr me !
19,1.0,"DISAPPOINTED ,DUPLICATE PRODUCTDon‚Äôt purchase any boat headphone from Amazon, that was duplicate product,there is number started with R printed on head band ,not present in this product..Side determination as L/R not mentioned over metallic bar over head band,no boat logo printed over apex of head band,lastly poor quality sound and bass,quality of cushion over ear cups was of cheap material.After returning that I purchased same model from Myntra,where all points I mentioned satisfied me‚Ä¶DONT PURCHASE ANY BOAT PRODUCT FROM AMAZON"
20,5.0,"Best at this price(999)I bought this to attend online classes of my college the battery life is very awesome i charge it once for 4-5 hours and it keeps working for more than a week, the quality of sound is nice but long hours of listening causes pain in ears which almost every headphones do,other than that best headphones, i purchased these at 999 in Amazon sale so at a big profit. Thanks for reading."
21,1.0,Just okay. Not so great.This product is just okay and not so great.I would have rated 3.5-4 star but below are the reason why I rated less.Reduced 1.5-2 start because of product quality. Build quality of head phone is just-just average ar somewhat between below average to average. The charging cable & jack cable are of very bad-cheap quality.Also reduced 1 star because it is not compatible with many devices for e.g. my use-case was to use it with my MacBook but it is not working with it. I is just working with Windows laptop / Android phone but I most use head phone with my MacBook for meetings.Hence 1 star.Thanks
22,5.0,"Battery lifeI have been using this earphone for 4 months now, i was not sure about it first but now I am fairly satisfied . Here are some honest  pros and cons of this earphone.PROS:1. Battery: I can't express how much I am satisfied with it, The packaging says 12 hrs runtime ,but it clearly gives me over 20 hrs. I usually have to charge it 2-3 timesa month. Believe me it sounds unbelievable but it is true.2. Sound quality : sound quality is fairly clear and bass is also very good, at this price  it is as expected.3. Comfortable: I was not sure about comfort first as my ears were was hurting too much, BUT after 2-3 DAYS IT BEACAME TOTALLY COMFORTABLE. Now if I wear it for whole day long, my ears don't even feel itCONS:1. light and generic build quality, it's very light and generic, doesn't give a premium feel ,and always I have to use it cautiously because i feel it would break2. Mike is very very  bad, no one can hear my voice through mike3. If you stand near wi fi router, it may cause interference in sound."
23,4.0,"Just Above Average Product.For the price of 1100 with bluetooth 5, its a 4 star product. Some flaws are there too. Made of plastic, so will easily degrade/break. The funtion keys only work on bluetooth mode not with AUX cable. Ear cushion not too great, after long hours it may cause pain in ears."
24,3.0,"Uncomfortable, pain in earsI am using this headphone from last 2 days, here's my experience -1. I got this one for 13992. Battery capacity is really good, 10+ hrs3. Sound quality is good4. Bluetooth connectivity is good5. The biggest problem is its ear cushions, they're really tight , you can't wear it continuously even for an hour"

26,1.0,"What a stupid waste of moneyI can't believe the experience I've had with these headphones, when they arrived, I was unable to activate the warranty for it even after following all the steps mentioned in the package. Just after 20 days one side stopped working but it would suddenly start and stop working from time to time. I tried calling a service station but no one would pick up and provide me with any assistance, after a month and a half, one side has completely stopped working and now these headphones are just a waste, I wrote them a mail as well to help me with this issue and got no response. Don't buy this product it's not durable at all and has basically no after-sales support."
27,5.0,"Noise Cancellation?? My Son Can't Hear Me When I'm Right Next To Him!! :)My son says the sound is AWESOME (all-caps = excitement level!), and he's 14 years old so that's a HUGE compliment for this amazing product. As for noise cancellation, he doesn't even hear me when I'm right next to him and speaking directly to him - that's how good it is!The build quality is excellent and it lasts for quite a bit longer than the stated time for a single charge. He uses it almost constantly and I haven't seen him charging it more than a couple of times a week.I think this is a very attractive price point because this kind of sound is usually only available on premium brands like JBL and Bose. I also bought some earpods from boAt and I'm pretty happy with that as well. Looks like the brand is very dedicated to providing the best user experience possible at an affordable price."
28,1.0,"Not worth itWas working fine for the 1st week. Started to hear a crackling disturbance all the time, in around 2 weeks after buying it. Sadly, the return window had been closed by then. Now stuck with this useless e-waste. Fitting is very tight and uncomfortable. Of all the Bluetooth headsets I have used, this is the most uncomfortable and pathetic product. Go for something else even if they give it for free. As long as it was working fine, sound quality was good with proper noise cancelation."
29,1.0,"Technical issueIt's been 2 months since I'm using this product..my review is absolutely genuine as i'm facing some issues regarding this product. At the first 2 weeks the cushion (on the ear) of the headphone got removed somehow it could be poor built quality . Then after some time the sound from from left side of the headphone was also not coming. Initially, I though that there could be some issues from my mobile so I restarted the phone but it didn't work out. Then I connected the headphone via bluetooth to the other mobile but it didn't worked as well.. I suppose the headphone itself have an issue.. It might be hardware problem.. REALLY DISAPPOINTED!!"
30,4.0,"Average headphones with good mic qualityHey there i purchased this headphones mostly for microphone and online classes. As microphone was my top priority I tested microphone quite a lot with bot pc and phone with some music during late night studies :)Pros----very nice microphone , the other person was able to hear me properly even if i was far from Device. One thing to note is when on pc you have to use AG handsfree calling mode not stereo else you won't be able to listen anything what other ppl is saying. Also ag is mono channel so it degrades sound quality which u get from headphones.But this isn't this headphones issue its just bluetooth mess which no one bothers to fix.----battery lifeBattery life is quite good tbh will easily last 3 4 days if u do mostly online classes and little music listening at night :)----connectivityConnectivity is pretty solid between the walls yeah bit struggles but considering how congested my airspace is with radiowaves blasting here and there connection was pretty solid.Cons:-----buildBuild is cheap and hollow , i expect cheap but it feels like toy and not at all sturdy , so handle with care-----sound qualitySound quality is below average tbh , on 50% volume its good , but when u go around 20% 25% then the headphones starts to skip few beats which are of lower amplitude , i dont know if its my unit of what but it does this every time. And wonder why i listen at 20% coz at night 20% feels like 60% of day coz we perceive volume relative to other volumes/loudness.-----comfortWell i am bit comfy person soo this for me is not much comfortable , i mean 1hr and its done i have to take break of 5 min or so , it's a good thing if u think about your ears but stillüòÖ"
31,5.0,"A decent product for a reasonable price!First of all, hats off to boat. They are improving their product range in every way they can. I saw some reviews in which people moaning about no noise cancelation, poor bass poor quality etc.. please don't bullshit. This is a good product. Look the price! It is very apt product during exercises like heavy lifting. If you want best bass, go for boss. If you want best anc, go for senheisser. This is an economical product. Boat will introduce their flagship anc headset soon and I'm waiting for it. Kudos for boat team."
32,2.0,Its a cheap version at high price.The product comes with good package details. But the features are very hard to use. like pressing the button to start or cancel a call is very tough.Sound quality is poor. And its not comfortable to the ears. Its like something heavy is sitting on your ears.Bluetooth auto pairing failed when u receive an incoming call.you really have to struggle to connect.I tried both with my Iphone and Redme device.Don't waste your money on this. Not worth of 999 INR
33,3.0,Balanced sound but longtime aches ear cause cufs are kinda hardSuggestions-  1.  I got it on 2021 during great Indian festival for 899 don't buy it if its at 1.2k or more than that it ain't worth it.  2. Try out the boat rockerz 450 on sale it was priced the same at 899 normally it is around 1.5k  3. Don't spend more than 1k on headphones if you don't have that much budget or you're a student  4. After buying these products goto the company's official website & register the purchase invoice for warranty claim.Like-  1. Good sound quality & sound balance not high base or high pitch balanced in all these  2. Noise cancellation good  3. Bluetooth connectivity good (v 5.0)  4. Comes with aux cable in the box  5. Battery backup is good too(1-2 day 100%-30% in normal usage)Dislike-  1. Cufs are kinda hard type though they contribute in good noise cancellation but ears ache too üòê thumbs down for very long time usage; Solution- make a habit of itüòÇ  2. Right ear cuff comes loose unattached. It's not like its broken or something but it comes in the box like that

It just broke .. as you can see. As one moth is over Amazon won't take it back. Whome to blame here Amazon or boat company!!If you still want to purchase..... Then go for jbl and sony products. Atleast they'll last much longer than than this pathetic product. You may spend 500-1000 extra money, but it worth it.Plz don't buy this product.. after using half an hour your ears will start paining. Instead on ads they should work on quality of products.it broke after usage of one month.totally wastage of money."

37,3.0,Only bass is goodBass n sound quality is good. But while making calls other end can't hear me properly. Another issue is that ear start to pain after some time. Also built quality n material quality is very low don't look like a big brand product in real. Low quality plastic.
38,4.0,"Above average...This headphone is good for non-bass lovers. Like, if you don't listen to deep bass music, this headphone is good.

39,5.0,"Cristal clear sound, stylish and perfect for any moment of your lifeThis product has a super good sound quality, it has dual mode and the size of the headphones can also be increased. If you are a student it's best for doing online classes, listning musicüéµ, making calls and ofcourse gaming. You can spend hours while wearing it!! So just tag along and the product is real. It also comes with the aux wire to use it in a normal wire. Wear it and just rock!!"
40,4.0,"Good productListening Music during walking is trouble, sound breaks. Mic needs to be closer to mouth while speaking on call otherwise person on the other end complains of voice breaking.You are sitting and headphones are connected to phone/pc ( stationary), then it gives flawless performance.Not for long use, as ears get heated, irritable, sweaty."
41,3.0,"Buy it when your budget is super tight !Decent product1. Build quality - not so nice feels very cheap and sometimes I just thought I broke it...Cushion are very poor in quality,2. Comfort - not so comfortable,Feels like someone press your head so tightly.3. Music quality - high and mids are descent but base should be more soft.Overall it's sounds good.After 4 days of use left driver were gone. So I've returned this product so buy it at your own risk!!!"
42,2.0,"Bad and good.First things first. While opening the pack itself earcup of one side was not in its position. .i.e it was seperated from the headphone ( please refer to image). I was really sad, as I bought this for diwali. I am using boat gadgets from past 2 years, never experienced such things. However, somehow managed to attach those earcup to the headphone. Apart from that, headphone is good. Felt ear pain after using for half an hour, I hope I will get used to it. Sound quality is good, built quality is ok for this price(‚Çπ 899).Update: built quality is not at all good. I think spending little more money and buying some other brand or other model in this same brand is better option."
43,4.0,"Best headphone in this price rangeThis headphone is the best one out there in this price range. After searching alot for wireless headphones, I finally came up to this and I'm not disappointed. The bass is fantastic and the sound quality is good. But the sound on full volume isn't too loud. So if u have a habit of listening music on very loud volumes, then this is not for u. It's not like the sound is too low, it's just not that loud compared to other headphones but I still enjoy listening music in it. The design is very attractive and the red colour looks beautiful. It's comfortable but u may need to remove it for a few seconds and adjust it again cuz the ears start hurting after using it for like 1-1.5 hours. And most importantly, it has a 1 year warranty. But there's only one thing which I hated about this is that the usb cable provided doesn't even fit in it. Didn't they test it before putting it in? I had to use my phone cable to charge it. Other than that, it's goodMy final verdict- 9/10"
44,4.0,Full review plz read it before buying the headset.Hi I am going to give clear review about this headset.First of all sound quality is very supper.Bass is also good it comes according to song requirment.Noice cancellation is ok.Battery backup is very powerful.It's sound processing is awesome.I had noticed sound from left speaker comes loud and basse and whereas right has more of vocal therefore sound generated feels like surrounding sound.But it's irritating something but due to this effect sound comes properly.But biggest backpoint is confort you can't were it continues for 1 hrs After some time ears start paining.Overall is perfect product and value for money. Please tell that sound in left speaker is more that right speaker or its my headphones problem.
45,4.0,everything is good but...the sound quality is great the bass is okay but i do not suggest you to buy this if you are a gamer or use the headphones all day long-the headphone's cushion is not that soft so using it for more than 1 hour can irritate youi dont know if this is a me thing but i get headaches when i wear these.. if you see any other reviews complaining about headaches then dont buy it..
46,4.0,A reasonable choice for the price.Writing the review after using 1 week*The ratings I am giving are according to my preference and keep in mind the price also.Sound quality- 3.5/5 - The sound could have been more bright and the bass was good. Vocal separation was okayish.Comfort- 3/5- The earcups are not that soft and start to hurt in long use.Build- 3.5/5 - The build is all plastic with matte finish. Its not that fragile to break easily unless you really try.Battery-4.5/5- The battery life was quite impressive. My daily use is about 5-6 hours and it easily lasted me around 6-7 days on single charge and you also get aux cable if you run out of battery.I also have boat rockerz 450 and the sound quality in that is just slightly better but it is way more comfortable than this so if you have to wear headphones for very long time continuously you can go for it but it also costs more and the build quality on that in quite good too.
47,2.0,"Battery Champ under 1kBought this for 999/-Its only good thing is battery life. Charging time around 1 hour and gives 3 days of battery life.Bass is fine, you have to tweak the settings in equalizer from phone apps but other than that its fine. ( rockerz 400 had way more bass but very less battery life 8hrs)Sound quality is good for its price, cant complain.the teal blue colour is my fav, it just looks very attractive and also fits well. ( you will get slight discomfort and pain after long usage for around 4 hrs and more, but in time you'll get used to it.)so yes I only love it for the looks and battery life :)Edit: the plastic broke and my headphone is in 2 parts so it's useless after 3 months"

Nothing changed after replacement. I am telling you don't buy this product, it is very harmful for ears, and also it startes paining on ears and nearby ears area. Overall it is worst product. Very clear, it makes unwanted pain just after 10-15 minutes of using. If we don't use for 10-15 minutes then we must not buy such kind of product in my point of view...."

However when connected with 3.5mm jack it sounded good.Have filed for the replacement and hoping the replacement to work fine."

I bought it in the ‚ÄòRaging Red‚Äô colour scheme which is a combination of red and black which I love. Overall, this pair of headphones is definitely worth it!"
54,4.0,Brilliant product !!!Amazing product !! Specially build quality... Design & controls as well ! Some special areas to be mentioned.. i.e. bass is good so with that vocals are very clear... Bluetooth connectivity also very strong !! Noise cancellation not upto mark but ok & aux cable quality is weak so i think new aux cable need to purchase for those who need dual connectivity otherwise bluetooth are stong to work! One thing specially mention about bass quality that some romours about it that bass eliminated ! But it's totally wrong bass is exist but not so strong so it can help in to hear vocals clearly also ears not damaged with that ! One last earcups are so comfy & also headphone adjust very well with that with head... Overall weight is also good !With low or medium budget it valuable product !!
55,2.0,Very difficult switches to put the headphones off.Very difficult switches to put the headphones off. Its ok to get connected to your mobile device with this headphone but bey difficult to switch off the headphone without first switching off the mobile device. Its a nightmare experience to use it only because of this reason.......
56,3.0,"Sound quality is fine. But it keeps disconnecting from the phone. .Specially if you are not playing songs on your device and the headphone is connected via bt, it keeps connecting and disconnecting every 5 min, while playing an audio msg ""you have now been disconnected "" and "" you are now connected to rockers 350"". It's very annoying and also makes my Samsung m31 lag"
57,1.0,"worst,worst,worst,not worth  of giving one starIt is made of low quality plastic which broke within two months of delivery.Worst product not worth for buying. Sound quality is very bad and there is no noise cancellation and bluetooth connection often fail and sometimes it didn't help me for handsfree calling."
58,5.0,"Best in the budgetFirst of all it's the best thing you can have under 1k . First of all the sound is good , there is minor distortion at full volume but normal person will regret it , although no one will use at full volume . The bass is awesome , vocals are clear and there is some noice cancellation at upper volume . I have issue that the earcups are soft but not for long term use bcoz headphone apply pressure and cups also not manage it . You cannot use for long-term use . The build is plastic and the extenders are also plastic but not that weak that they cannot handle pressure ,  if you do that with patiently . Although a good buy if you want it !!!!"
59,2.0,Not satisfied with mike quality.I used this head the audio quality is fine but mike quality is not good. When I attend a zoom or team meeting then others complaints for voice quality however the internet connection is very good.  I am not totally satisfied with this product. We can not return this item.
60,1.0,"Bad quality of material usedNot recomanded : it is late review, I understand but the headphone broke into two pieces after 4 months I brought it in August and got broke it into Dec. There is no customer care or service contact available."

I mean I'm super impressed.. hardly sm scratches here n there n it's good.. go for it.. rough n tough n great sound quality, amazing looks.. hats off!!"
63,5.0,Very good quality headphones in this price range...üëåI've been using these headphones for 2 months and they are really good..from sound quality to bass everything's perfect..noise cancellation is less but the price is also less...so you can go ahead..nice product...

65,4.0,"The sound quality is good But ...Continues usage, say more than 1-1.30hr may irritate ears. Because of less air circulation around the ears, it may get sweat after some point of time, cushion felt tight fit. Apart from that sound quality and bass is fine. battery backup is too good. I'm getting10-15days of battery backup.I use 30-60mts daily"
66,5.0,"Brand is always brand .  I have 2 boats headphones üéßBoat rockerz 370 is awesome .in quality ,bass and all cool.

Boat headphones is brand. Brand is brand.  Long lasting battery."
67,5.0,"Budget friendly and does the jobI took it solely for gaming and WFH purpose. It does the job, I connect it and it stays powered on for more than 8hrs a day on a single full charge. Music, gaming and calls. Best when using sitting, standing walked. I do not recommend wearing it to the bed, it is delicate and can break.The cushions add to the noise cancellation, bass quality is good. Lows are pretty decent. The highs are not that great"
68,5.0,"Not for ONLINE CLASSES‚ö† Don't buy for online classes, this is not for heavy use, you can use for 1 hour to hear song, that it self create ear pain, other than this every thing is super üëå, for ONLINE CLASSES you can buy boat immortal 200 d just >500 rs more it's is a gaming head for using is mobile you need otg cable."
69,1.0,"Absolutely garbage1) The sound quality is very poor, it's barely passable using in Bluetooth, but with the aux cords provided in the box it's absolutely garbage.2) the build quality feels very cheap and flimsy. It feels like it'd break in half if I try to put even a little bit of force.3) the size of the earpieces are quiet small. It starts to hurt my ears after 5-10 minutes of usage. This headphone is not made for people with average to big head."
70,5.0,Must buy if you want wireless headphone in this prizeOne of the best headphones I have had.good for online classes and meetings.great for whatching online shows and movies.and fairly long Bluetooth range for this prize.slightly uncomfortable but other aspects of this headphone covers it up.

78,3.0,"Good wireless headphonesConnectivity and battery backup is good. In a single charge, it can give 6-8 hours playtime. You can easily wear it and roam within rooms.One limitation is that its not comfortable for long usage. Its difficult to wear continuously for more that 1 hour."
79,3.0,"Poor Bluetooth connectivityI'm an average height individual. When I connect Rokerz 370 and put my phone into my pant pocket, the connection to the headphone gets disrupted. I have to hold the phone in my hands and close to the headset to re-establish Bluetooth connection.I feel cheated because of this."

91,2.0,Quite Uncomfortable to wearWith around  20-30 mins of usage my earlobes started to hurt a lot these headphones have a very sung fit which apparently makes them  uncomfortable to wear but the sound quality is quite good for the price I am going to return the item inspite of the sound quality consider buying an over-ear headphone if you are going to use it for a long time or if you have a large head .
92,1.0,"Not good qualityBattery is good but as compared to other headphone, this sound quality is not good. Feels irritating when you sit on online classes.I suggest better go with 450 boat headphone.This one is very poor. My 450 boat headphone broked as i stepped in it badly. So, I bought this one.Please don't buy this if you can invest little more buy 450, as it's really comfortable"
93,5.0,"Overall a good productLiked overall quality of the product. One peculiar thing is that after every use of connecting with the mobile,  few ads in Chinese started appearing on Google  news site. Also alibaba.com ads also were seen. This problem got eliminated when I connected headphones with wires to my computer. Now it's okay to use. Battery life is very good. It can last for couple of days for a limited use."
94,4.0,"Warranty laptop is awesomeHead phone is awesome  but after wearing for 30 min ,ears will start to pain ,,but after removing the head phone 30 second , its good to wear again,,, to need to worry to about warranty there is 1year warranty , and also warranty card is given and there is no on the card ,if u give miss call u can register for warranty , connect with laptop and mobile is amazing ,,, it's also best for running and exercise"

97,3.0,Dissatisfied from boat atleast 450 is better than this.Sound quality and build in quality is too bad at 70 to 80% volume left ear's speaker starts shaking and there is too much distortion it seems like someone is hammering on you left ear and not at all comfortable. One good thing it's very light because they have used only plastic which can  easily break.
98,3.0,"Sound quality to improve, cable quality lowSound quality is average, only advantage is converting to use as regular head phone when BT battery drains off. Certain other boat products have better sound quality. Chord given for 3.5 mm jack is flimsy, better quality aux cable should have been give"
99,3.0,Headphone broken by slight forceProduct is good but strengthwise product is too fragile. It got broken while wearing it with normal push.Don't buy this product. Earlier I read similar reviews but still went for buying due to brand name but now I suggest everyone reading this review not to go for it.

102,1.0,"Bluetooth stoped working after 2 days of buying.Worst product I've ever bought in Amazon.The Bluetooth stoped working after 2 days, so I ordered a replacement, and the replaced product's Bluetooth also stoped working after 6days. It's unfortunate that I lost the box with garuntee card, I can't even change the product or ask for refund.Regarding sound, it starts breaking at hight pitch. You may have a hard time wearing it for more than 30 mins."
103,2.0,Avg productMany time...the other person cannot hear our voice through headphones....many times v r not able to hear there voice...so needs to reconnect ...it shws disconnected even if its connected...
104,5.0,terrificits sound is very good its not noise cancellation but deep bass is so good that you will feel noise cancelation feature I prefer this headphone to music lovers and online studies and you can connect with aux cable and bluetooth.Note: if your network is slow or weak the headphone will not give a good sound
105,5.0,Go for itTruly good productNice sound qualityIt has wire also to connect headphones to laptop/phone so that if the device has not bluetooth function you can connect headphones with the device
106,1.0,Don't buy this it is totoal waste of money.After using for 2 months it started disconnecting from bluetooth automatically.And the material is also of very low quality.Mine headphone broke when I was trying to wear it and when asked for servicing they said that the sound is comming and we will not do anything.Cheap quality.Buy some other headphone of boat only but don't buy this one.Total waste of money...

109,4.0,"Not comfortableNot comfortable to use as the cushion pads presses the ears tightly so that you will get irritated just after 10 mins of use. Better to go for the ones which has bigger ear pads, so that it covers your full ear. There is no return policy also, so I couldn't return it. Better not to go with this. Sound and build quality is ok."
110,4.0,"a boat wireless headphone is good choice - it gives me around 12 hrs playback on full charge ,Well over all its good choice and good looking at this peice rangeBut some times it just stops working and just didn't switched on even after pressing the power button for a long time also the cushion paddingbis not soft so it causes pain in my ear after prolong use , and there are better choice in the market"
111,4.0,Average all rounderIt is very good i mean the sound and all it good at this price range. But its build quality is not upto the mark and it may break easily on the edges and most importantly the charging point and aux cable are creating few problems in the device but in some device they perform okay. So it have some problems but at this price range i think it is okay.üôÇ
112,1.0,"Don't work with mac and ear hurts in short period of timeWhen i got it then that day it was working completely fine with macbook using Bluetooth but now no matter what i do it doesn't connect with Bluetooth to my mac, have to use wire which limits me to sit in my chair, however the Bluetooth works fine with android device. and the ear hurts after using around half an hour. i don't say product is bad but these two things are not working me."
113,1.0,Worthless wired headphoneRechargeable battery dies contantly.  The microphone does not work.  It is just a wired headphone with ordinary sound.  Just deception.  Worthless junk.
114,1.0,"Very uncomfortable within 1 hr use. Don't buy!The only good thing about these headphones is average sound quality. Nothing to boast of. The major issue is that they are VERY uncomfortable. They dont fit your ears and they would give immense pain within an hour of constant usage. That said, they can't be returnable or replacable. I feel like its a waste of 1000 Rs."
115,1.0,Ok but don't buy read this firstI tell you guys don't invest money on this buy air pods or air buds because I have used it for 6-8 months all good but the strips from where we extend the headphones that is of very low quality and that's the main thing... And mine got broken one time while opening one day.... I managed and applied feviquick but it got boked again within a week so don't buy... Invest in air buds
116,4.0,"Good in this price range.If you're in search of device under ‚Çπ999 then you must buy this.

119,2.0,Got in bad conditionThe box I received was little bit damaged. These headphones are attractive but build quality is poor.Aux cable sound is horrible. Very less weight and poor build quality.These headphones cannot be used for online classes as it will pain in your ears. The earcuffs will not cover your ear properly and clamp force is very much.Its not worth buying.

121,1.0,pathetic product and servicesPathetic product and service. Flip got broken within 3 months and when i went to service center they said it wont consider under warranty and when i asked to repair by taking some charge they denied to do that as well. It means if you buy boat product and it got broke for any reason in one day then u just have to through your product into. Dustbin. DO NOT BUY BOAT ANY PRODUCT
122,4.0,"Good quality but careful with The charging port.It's been a year since I have been using this and it had no problem when it arrived. Last month or so the charging port came lose.

I gave it to company for repair as it was still under warranty and they repaired it without any cost. Other than that no problem at all."
123,4.0,Perfect sound but it could be better.This is a very good headphone to use. Everything with the sound is top class.Just the build quality could elevate it to a better standard.Otherwise it's quite good!

156,1.0,Boat Is waste and 3rd Class ProductI did not like anything in it .  Boat Rockerz 370 is waste.At the 1st Day only  The left side of the Headphone was  not working . No manual and no warranty card was given . They have given me a dummy piece .
157,4.0,Ultralight Headset To wear whole day!!Product is absolute in terms of quality sound and battery. One thing to notice is headset is so Light weight that remains unnoticed and releif when you wear it. No Cons now and Could go for it... i got it for 1099/-üòä where It went for 1499/-on amazon the next day and already out of stock for 2999/- on boatüôÄ

159,2.0,"Sound is good, but very tight on ears.The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Sound is good. But, after a 10-20 mins that tightness would start making one uncomfortable. Especially, if you have specs (I do), then there will be red marks on your ears because of the tight fit. It is that tight. Boat, do something about this please."
160,3.0,Nice productSound and bass are well definable for such price the only thing why i returned it is I can't wear it for more than 30 mins at a time because its on-ear type and my ears start to hurt after certain period of time after wearing it

This is something i didn't want... Maybe for this reason i should return it or not? Feel puzzle! This is not fair."
170,2.0,Good product but disappointing Company Service and trust..I bought it three months ago and it was really a nice product but now it started making some sound and vibrating problems..For that I sent it to customer care and now I have received my headphone without my accessories... It's really disappointing from a multinational Indian company.

The mic sound is feeble and doesnt pick up the voice very well."
176,1.0,"Don't waste your money.. Cheap quality plasticCheap quality plastic is used in the bands of the headphones. Mine broke don't know how in just 3 months. And I tried to get in touch with the company for replacement or repair, got no reply from them. My money got wasted."

178,1.0,"Worst headphoneWorst quality sound. There is no bass at all. Only good thing about this headphone is it looks good. If you are buying it to listen to music, just don't bother. A 600 rupees headphone bought from a local shop produces better quality sound."

182,3.0,"Bad mic, sound gets cut off.It has good sound quality, but it often gets cut off on one ear or both of them. The mic isn't that great either, I'd even go as far as to say that it's terrible, actually. Nobody hears anything unless you're screaming, it's just strange."
183,5.0,"Good headphone for it's price range!!Good pair of headphones for the given price range!! Compact and easy to carry since it's foldable. Decent bass and noise cancellation levels. One minus would be the aux cable is too thin, don't think it will last long. Anyways a good buy."

185,3.0,"AverageFor a boAt product its quiet cheap. But the thing is that after buying it, within 3 months I'm facing issues with it.

188,4.0,GoodThe product is a little small than what is shown in the pic inseterted by Amazon. Also it's important to note that this headphone is so fit that there won't be any air passage when it's kept on our ears. Technically the product is good and fine.

204,3.0,"if you're okay with settling for something moderate and mediocre, this is for you.The sound quality is pretty fine. That's the only thing I found pretty fine. The use of buttons on the headphones is not really convenient, not smooth. Your ears start to feel the pressure only after some time of using it. The bluetooth connectivity is okay, overall this device hasn't satisfied me."
